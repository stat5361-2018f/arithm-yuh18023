Approximation

I start with n=100, t=0 as my first approximation by using the following code:

```{r}
j <- 0
x <- rnorm(100)
#generating 100 N(0,1) numbers randomly, n=100
for (i in 1:100) {
  if (x[i]<=0){
#setting t=0
    j=j+1
  }else{
    j=j
  }
  
}
y <- j/100

```

Here my first output 0.46 is one approximated value of P(x<=0) in N(0,1) given n=100. Similarly, I get in total 27 approximated value for every combination of t and n by replacement of t and n. And the following table is the comparison between the true value of P(x<=t) and the approximated one.

     t n..100 n..1000 n..10000      True
