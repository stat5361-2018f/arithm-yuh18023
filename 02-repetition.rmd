Repetition of the experiment

After taking single approximation, two questions come up to my mind: due to different n, which estimation model is the most precise one? Does t have influence on the veracity of experiment? Therefore, I repeat the whole experiment 100 times in order to analyze the bias of estimation starting at n=100,t=0 by using the following code:

```{r}
x <- matrix(rnorm(10000),100,100)
for (n in 1:100) {
  j <- 0
  for (m in 1:100) {
  if(x[n,m]<=0){
    j=j+1
  }else{
    j=j
  }
  
  }
  bias <- mean(j/100)-pnorm(0)
}
bias
```
